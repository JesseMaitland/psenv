1. create something to allow param diff. This should just return the diff between the parameter store and what is in
the local .env file.

2. create a push diff feature. A user wants to just push a parameter that has been added to a given environment to the
parameter store, not overwrite the entire batch each time.

3. create a destroy diff feature. This allows removing simply a single parameter from an environment from the parameter
store. Currently to achieve this, a user must first delete the entire environment, and then re-push.
